# Work Day Scheduler

## Description

The goal is the following:

**
User Story
- AS AN employee with a busy schedule
- I WANT to add important events to a daily planner
- SO THAT I can manage my time effectively

Acceptance Criteria

- GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
- WHEN I open the planner
- THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
- WHEN I scroll down
- THEN I am presented with timeblocks for standard business hours
- WHEN I view the timeblocks for that day
- THEN each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
- WHEN I click into a timeblock
- THEN I can enter an event
- WHEN I click the save button for that timeblock
- THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
- WHEN I refresh the page
- THEN the saved events persist
**

While I have met the requirements for this project, there are additional features that would optimize the usage of it such as:

- figure out why the 1 PM is that big
- include the option to clear the user's inputs
- optimize/debug the feature to have a gradient in the "present" class. I find this importat because, that way it will be a visual representation of where the hour is at, which would remove the possibilties of any confusion that could result as is. for example, if it is 10:58 AM - assuming the user is using only the calendar to check in and plan - the present color would indicate that there's still enough time alloted to complete said task, which is a little misleading given there's only 2 more minutes to 11 AM. In conclusion, this feature would reduce the potential for uncertainty and anxiety.

The image below displays what the scheduler looks like:
