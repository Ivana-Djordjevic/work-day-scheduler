# Work Day Scheduler

## Description

The goal is the following:

**
User Story
- AS AN employee with a busy schedule
- I WANT to add important events to a daily planner
- SO THAT I can manage my time effectively

Acceptance Criteria

- GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
- WHEN I open the planner
- THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
- WHEN I scroll down
- THEN I am presented with timeblocks for standard business hours
- WHEN I view the timeblocks for that day
- THEN each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
- WHEN I click into a timeblock
- THEN I can enter an event
- WHEN I click the save button for that timeblock
- THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
- WHEN I refresh the page
- THEN the saved events persist
**

While I have met the requirements for this project, there are additional features that would optimize the usage of it such as:

- user experience: include the option to clear the user's inputs
- optimize/debug the feature to have a gradient in the "present" class. I consider this feature to be of great importance as it enables a clear and concise visual representation of the current hour, eliminating any potential confusion that may arise with the current version of the application. For instance, suppose a user is solely relying on the scheduler for time management and it is currently 10:58 AM. At first glance, the present color would indicate that it is still in the 10 AM range, which is a little misleading given there's only 2 more minutes to 11 AM. This could lead the user to believe that there's enough time alloted for the given task(s) in that hour. Thus, incorporating this feature would significantly mitigate the likelihood of uncertainty and it would instill trust in the application.

The image below displays what the scheduler looks like:
